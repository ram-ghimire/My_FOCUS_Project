# Introduction
My name is Ram Ghimire, currently working as a Research Projects Officer in wheat leaf architecture and yield project. I have been working with data of crop physiology & agronomy for many years but have had no experience in R. Most of my data manipulation and visualisation are done in Excel. I  came to know about Data School from colleagues and got opportunity to join this year. Before joining Data School, I was used to spending a lot of time working with data mostly in excel spreadsheets. Now, I am delighted to see how amazing R can be for processing and visualisation of the field and laboratory data that I collect every year.

# My Project
Rather than yourself, this is the space to introduce your **project**. What are 
your goals, what is your data, how do you plan to work with it? Perhaps show some example data if 
it would help.

In order to build this demo poster correctly, you will also need to have installed the `tidyverse`, 
`gapminder`, and `kableExtra` packages.

## Preliminary results
In this study we evaluated different components of variation for canopy architecture lines developed from Australian commercial spring wheats.

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

**Images from a file**

**Plots from R**
```{r standard-plot, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Yet another gapminder plot"}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1987) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, colour = continent, size = pop)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10(labels = function(b) format(b, scientific = F)) +
  scale_size(trans = "sqrt", guide = "none") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Your figure and table captions are automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text
if needed: see eg. Table \@ref(tab:mytable) and Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot)

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Do you expect that everything will be able 
to be completed within R, or will you need to work with multiple tools to get the right result?
Which of the digital skills needed for your project have you learned since starting Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here. What about this tool makes it your favourite?

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

What parts of your project take the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

This summary is mostly about your project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? Have you
tried applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!

# My thanks to you
Stephen Pearce, Kerensa McElroy, Luke Barret, Aswin Singaram, Natarajan, Emmett Leyne, Gilbert Permaloo and other helpers who have dedicated their time to teach us R in classroom and in group sessions, and special thanks to Kristian Goodacre for amazingly organising the whole training program & ensuring everyone is on board during this different from a normal setting. Also great thanks to my research group, Richard Richards, Anne Rae, Wolfgang Spielmeyer and Gonzalo Estavillo for allowing me opportunity to learn R through Data School FOCUS.
